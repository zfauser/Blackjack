      The goal of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over it. You start by getting two cards. You can see one of the dealer's cards. You can choose to hit (get another card), stand (keep your current cards), or double down (double your bet get another card (you can only do this on your first turn)). If you go over 21, you lose. If you get 21, you win. If you get closer to 21 than the dealer, you win. If the dealer gets closer to 21 than you,
      you lose. If you and the dealer tie, it's a push.
